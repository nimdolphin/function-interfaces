#Function Interfaces

## Description

This project includes three functionalities:

1. **DNA to RNA Conversion**: Converts a DNA sequence into an RNA sequence.
2. **Palindrome Check**: Checks if a given string or number is a palindrome.
3. **Substring Extraction**: Extracts a substring from a given string based on the start index and length.

## Features

- **DNA to RNA Conversion**: Convert DNA sequences containing only A, C, G, and T into RNA sequences.
- **Palindrome Check**: Determine if the input string or number reads the same forwards and backwards.
- **Substring Extraction**: Extract a part of the string starting from a specific index with a specified length.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/nimdolphin/function-interfaces.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
  cd function-interfaces
```

## Usage

1. Open index.html in your web browser.

2. DNA to RNA Conversion: Enter a DNA sequence (e.g., "GATTACA") and click the "Convert" button.

3. Palindrome Check: Enter a string or number to check if it's a palindrome and click the "Check" button.

4. Substring Extraction: Enter a string, start index, and length to extract a substring and click the "Extract" button.
